The **Fraud Dataset Benchmark (FDB)** is a compilation of publicly available datasets relevant to **fraud detection** ([arXiv Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14417)). The FDB aims to cover a wide variety of fraud detection tasks, ranging from card not present transaction fraud, bot attacks, malicious traffic, loan risk and content moderation. The Python based data loaders from FDB provide dataset loading, standardized train-test splits and performance evaluation metrics. The goal of our work is to provide researchers working in the field of fraud and abuse detection a standardized set of benchmarking datasets and evaluation tools for their experiments. Using FDB tools we evaluate 4 AutoML pipelines including AutoGluon, H2O, Amazon Fraud Detector and Auto-sklearn across 9 different fraud detection datasets and discuss the results.

## Installation

### Requirements
- Kaggle account
    - **Important**: `ieeecis` dataset requires you to [**join IEEE-CIS competetion**](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ieee-fraud-detection/overview) from your Kaggle account, before you can call fdb API. Otherwise you will get <span style="color:red">ApiException: (403)</span>.
- AWS account
- Python 3.7+ 

- Python requirements
```
autogluon==0.4.2
h2o==3.36.1.2
boto3==1.20.21
click==8.0.3
click-plugins==1.1.1
Faker==4.14.2
joblib==1.0.0
kaggle==1.5.12
numpy==1.19.5

regex==2020.7.14
scikit-learn==0.22.1
scipy==1.5.4
auto-sklearn==0.14.7
dask==2022.8.1
```

### Step 1: Setup Kaggle CLI
The `FraudDatasetBenchmark` object is going to load datasets from the source (which in most of the cases is Kaggle), and then it will modify/standardize on the fly, and provide train-test splits. So, the first step is to setup Kaggle CLI in the machine being used to run Python.

Use intructions from [How to Use Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/api) guide. The steps include:

Remember to download the authentication token from "My Account" on Kaggle, and save token at `~/.kaggle/kaggle.json` on Linux, OSX and at `C:\Users<Windows-username>.kaggle\kaggle.json` on Windows. If the token is not there, an error will be raised. Hence, once youâ€™ve downloaded the token, you should move it from your Downloads folder to this folder.
  
    
#### Step 1.2. [Join IEEE-CIS competetion](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ieee-fraud-detection/overview) from your Kaggle account, before you can call `fdb.datasets` with `ieeecis`. Otherwise you will get <span style="color:red">ApiException: (403)</span>.
  
  
### Step 2: Clone Repo
Once Kaggle CLI is setup and installed, clone the github repo using `git clone https://github.com/amazon-research/fraud-dataset-benchmark.git` if using HTTPS, or `git clone git@github.com:amazon-research/fraud-dataset-benchmark.git` if using SSH. 

### Step 3: Install
Once repo is cloned, from your terminal, `cd` to the repo and type `pip install .`, which will install the required classes and methods.


## FraudDatasetBenchmark Usage
The usage is straightforward, where you create a `dataset` object of `FraudDatasetBenchmark` class, and extract useful goodies like train/test splits and eval_metrics.   

**Important note**: If you are running multiple experiments that require re-loading dataframes multiple times, default setting of downloading from Kaggle before loading into dataframe exceed the account level API limits. So, use the setting to persist the downloaded dataset and then load from the persisted data. During the first call of FraudDatasetBenchmark(), use `load_pre_downloaded=False, delete_downloaded=False` and for subsequent calls, use `load_pre_downloaded=True, delete_downloaded=False`. The default setting is 
`load_pre_downloaded=False, delete_downloaded=True`
```
from fdb.datasets import FraudDatasetBenchmark

# all_keys = ['fakejob', 'vehicleloan', 'malurl', 'ieeecis', 'ccfraud', 'fraudecom', 'twitterbot', 'ipblock'] 
key = 'ipblock'

obj = FraudDatasetBenchmark(
    key=key,
    load_pre_downloaded=False,  # default
    delete_downloaded=True,  # default
    add_random_values_if_real_na = { 
        "EVENT_TIMESTAMP": True, 
        "LABEL_TIMESTAMP": True,
        "ENTITY_ID": True,
        "ENTITY_TYPE": True,
        "ENTITY_ID": True,
        "EVENT_ID": True
        } # default
    )
print(obj.key)

print('Train set: ')
display(obj.train.head())
print(len(obj.train.columns))
print(obj.train.shape)

print('Test set: ')
display(obj.test.head())
print(obj.test.shape)

print('Test scores')
display(obj.test_labels.head())
print(obj.test_labels['EVENT_LABEL'].value_counts())
print(obj.train['EVENT_LABEL'].value_counts(normalize=True))
print('=========')

    - Description: Prepared by IEEE Computational Intelligence Society, this card-non-present transaction fraud dataset was launched during IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection Kaggle competition, and was provided by Vesta Corporation. The original dataset contains 393 features which are reduced to 67 features in the benchmark. Feature selection was performed based on highly voted Kaggle kernels. The fraud rate in training segment of source dataset is 3.5%. We only used training files (train transaction and train identity) containing 590,540 transactions in the benchmark, and split that into train (95%) and test (5%) segments based on time. Based on the insights from a Kaggle kernel written by the competition winner, we added UUID (called it as ENTITY_ID) that represents a fingerprint and was created using card, address, time and D1 features.
